          <h2>VASYL CHOVNITSKYI</h2>
          <p>Hi! My name is Vasyl and I am from Ukraine. I study Contemporary Communications at LCC International University. My life was always connected with music. When I was in first grade of school I started playing the flute. When I reached sixth grade I learned piano. Also, in tenth grade I decided to visit guitar classes. Among all those instruments I am the best at flute. My tenth grade also known for the fact that I started making music on my computer. At that time I really loved rap music, so I learned how to make rap beats. I recorded my own songs and I also used to receive orders from people. It was my first way to make money. Now, I want to do this on professional level and that is why I created this website. I want you to know more about me and, maybe, interest you.</p>
